# A Comparative Study of Cross-Chain MEV: Quantifying Its Economic Impacts

## Overview

This repository accompanies the research paper exploring cross-chain MEV, its economics, latency costs, and DeFI operations data between Solana and Ethereum.

This project and research paper presents a comparative study examining Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) across different blockchain networks and cross-chain environments, with a focus on quantifying the economic impacts of these extractable values.

## Abstract

Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) represents the profit a miner or validator can make through their ability to arbitrarily include, exclude, or reorder transactions within blocks. This study extends the analysis of MEV beyond single-chain environments to investigate cross-chain MEV opportunities and their broader economic implications.

## Research Objectives

- Analyze MEV patterns across multiple blockchain networks
- Quantify the economic impact of cross-chain MEV extraction
- Compare MEV opportunities between different blockchain architectures
- Assess the implications for network security and user experience
